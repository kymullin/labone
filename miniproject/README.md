This folder is for the Project Lab 1 mini project.

Project description:
Using the Basys3 FPGA board, do the following:
- Drive a rover DC motor in both directions at variable speeds
- Control direction and speed using SW [7:0] on the board
- Use the L298N H-bridge
- Detect when the motor current exceeds 1 A
- Use the 7 Segment display to indicate motor direction and current draw
